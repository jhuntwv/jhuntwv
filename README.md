Hello.  I'm Joshua Hunt, currently working in an entry level IT help desk position.  I recently passed CCNA and am pursuing a career in network automation - now going after the
DevNet Associate cert from Cisco.  I'm comfortable with Python and Linux.  I hope pursuing network automation will give me real world scenarios to practice those skills on.

In my personal life, I enjoy competing in Brazillian Jiujitsu and spending time outdoors with my wife and 2 children.
